            <h2>Which Is The National Flower Of UAE?</h2>
            <p>
                Tribulus Omanense is the national flower of UAE. For its unique medical properties, it has been extensively used in homeopathy medicines. Tribulus flower belongs to the Zygophyllaceae family whose sub-family is Tribuloideae. This charming flower is mostly available in warm countries and the color varies from yellow to dark yellow. It has 5 petals and the leaves are quite distinctive, unlike other flowers. Although, it is still not announced as the National flower of UAE, but, the residents of UAE have accepted Tribulus Omanese whole-heartedly as their National Flower. The main reason behind is its uniqueness and joyful yellow color. Yellow is the color of sunshine and reflects the Fire element and thus it is directly linked with hope and happiness. Yellow color symbolizes positivity, optimism, enlightenment, intellect, energy, cheerfulness, and loyalty. Apart from that yellow color also signifies friendship, equality, and brotherhood.
